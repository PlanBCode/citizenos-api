  "ABOUT_P1_1": "Citizen OS is an e-decisionmaking platform for communities. It enables participative discussion and voting for groups, where getting everyone together into the same room oronlineatthe same time is not an option. Inhabitants of a village. Members of an NGO spread out all over the country. Employees of a multinational company from different cities and timezones.Spontaneous citizen movements. Anyone can start a discussion.",
  "ABOUT_P1_2": "E-democracy. E-meetings. E-assemblies. E-discussions. E-decisionmaking. Citizen OS - the choice is yours.",
  "ABOUT_HEADING_WHY": "Why Citizen OS?",
  "ABOUT_WHY_P1": "How can you make a decision, when you need to involve a few dozen or a few thousand participants and they cannot all be in the same place at the same time, online or offline? Maybethey don’t even know each other by name or by face?",
  "ABOUT_WHY_P2": "You can choose a representative and have them make the choice. Or you can write a hundred million e-mails back and forth and try to count all the votes. We believe the time hascome,where technology can give the ability to participate in decisionmaking back to each and every person. Ancient Greeck forum style. Direct democracy style. Except we no longer needtogather at the market square.",
  "ABOUT_WHY_P3": "The system is simple: make a proposal >> discuss >> vote >> sign digitally >> follow up on implementation.",
  "ABOUT_WHY_HEADING_DESC": "Citizen OS is a platform where:",
  "ABOUT_WHY_LIST_FLOW_1": "everyone can <b>add a proposal</b>, publicly or privately. A petition to stop charging for household waste disposal in case it’s sorted is an exampleof a public proposal. Initiating a change in the statutes of an organisation is an example of a private proposal, where only the members of that organisation are invited to participate.",
  "ABOUT_WHY_LIST_FLOW_2": "proposals can be <b>discussed</b>. Every participant can comment, offer up alternatives, suggest arguments pro and con and edit wording. Everything is preserved in a single location, in a single feed.",
  "ABOUT_WHY_LIST_FLOW_3": "proposals can be <b>decided</b> on. You can use the veto system to reach a consensus. You can run mini-votes on wording issues. You can vote yes-no or between custom choices. You can delegate votes to other participants. In the future, you can even create your own voting system.",
  "ABOUT_WHY_LIST_FLOW_4": "decisions can be <b>properly formulated</b>. There are no anonymous comments and no anonymous votes. Every participant is identified either via social media or by the national digital ID / mobile ID. Voting results are presented as a statistical overview, as a visual summary and as a digitally signed container.",
  "ABOUT_WHY_LIST_FLOW_5": "decisions can <b>be followed up on</b>. Participants can enquire about the implementation status. Petitions, that have been signed by at least 1000 people, can be directly sent to the Estonian Parliament committee for discussion. Progress through the parliament can be followed up on.",
